 * Apologies for the strange file name.
 * Once I've figured out what it is really supposed to do,
 * I might rename it to something sensible, but for now it's named after
 * the strangest function it exports.   -- autc04, June 2018
 *
 * This code used to live in stdfile.h/stdfile.cpp, for no good reason at all.
 * 
 * It has nothing to do with the user interface for picking files.
 * Instead, it has to do with mounting HFS floppies and CD-ROMs.
